/*
This library is only of benefit in a script that does not have deferred callbacks enabled.

The purpose of this library is to trigger a function asynchronously from a MIDI callback.
You'll usually want to use this to update the GUI from with onNoteOn, onNoteOff or onController.;
Updating the GUI from one of these callbacks can cause audio dropouts because these callbacks run on the
real-time thread, this library solves that by providing a method to defer a function using a timer object.;

This library only supports the use of one deferred function at a time, to defer multiple functions you will need to
either combine those functions into one or modify this library to allow for multiple functions.
